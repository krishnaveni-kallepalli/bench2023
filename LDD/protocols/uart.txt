 Universal Asynchronous Reciever / Transmitter :
	exchanging serial data between two devices.
	used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port
	Eg: automobiles, smart cards and SIMs.
	
 UART is asynchronous :
 No clock signal to synchronize the output bits from the transmitting device going to the receiving end.

 1 master 1 slave

 Baud rate : 9600 - 115200 bps i.e transfer speed 
 
 UART :
 	simplex 	- (data is sent in one direction only), half-duplex (each side speaks but only one at a time), 
 	full-duplex -	(both sides can transmit simultaneously). 
 Data in UART is transmitted in the form of frames.
 
 
 UART frame format :
 1.start bit 	- transmitter needs to signal that data bits are coming
 2.data bit 		- 5 to 9 bit / 7 to 8 mostly
 3.Parity bit	- even/odd
    In even parity, this bit is set such that the total number of 1s in the frame will be even.
    In odd parity, this bit is set such that the total number of 1s in the frame will be odd.
 4.stop bit 		- top bit indicates the end of user data


 Example: 

 Transmitting : 
 send the capital letter “S” in 7-bit ASCII   1 0 1 0 0 1 1

 We first reverse the order of the bits to put them in least significant bit order  1 1 0 0 1 0 1


 Recieving : 
 1 0 1 0 0 1 1



 Two separate shift registers allows a UART to transmit and receive data at the same time.
 parallel data is converted to serial data sequences.
