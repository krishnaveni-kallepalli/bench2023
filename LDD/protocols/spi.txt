Serial Peripheral Interface :  synchronous, full duplex main-subnode-based interface
	interface bus commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripherals 
	Eg: shift registers, sensors, and SD cards.
Lines :
	SCLK - serial clock
	MOSI MISO - data lines
	CS - control select 
 It uses separate clock and data lines, along with a chip select line to choose the device you wish to talk to.
 
 Data transfer SPEED : upto 60Mbps
 output clock frequency : upto 50 MHz
 
 SPI is a full-duplex interface 
 both main and subnode can send data at the same time - MOSI and MISO 
 
 Synchronus :
 transmits and receives information simultaneously with high data transfer rates
 
 Device that generates the clock signal is called the main
 Data transmitted between the main and the subnode
 
 
 consists 1 main and can have 1 or multiple subnodes.
 chip select is used to select subnode
 
 CS is normally an active low signal and is pulled high to disconnect the subnode from the SPI bus
 
 
 MOSI and MISO are the data lines
 MOSI transmits data from the main to the subnode
 MISO transmits data from the subnode to the main.	
 
 
 In daisy-chain mode :	chip select signal 
 						all subnodes is tied together 
 						data propagates from one subnode to the next. 
 						all subnodes receive the same SPI clock at the same time. 
 The data from the main is directly connected to the first subnode and that subnode provides data to the next subnode and so on.
 
 
 In this method, as data is propagated from one subnode to the next.
 No.of clock cycles required to transmit data is proportional to the subnode position in the daisy chain.
 
 clk : 
 clock polarity - CPOL
 clock phase - CPHA
 
 can be 0 or 1
 4 modes
 CPOL	CPHA   CLK
  0		 0		raise to falling edge
  0		 1 		falling to raise
  1		 0		falling to raise 
  1		 1		raise to falling 
 
 
 Transmission :
 
 CS
 SCLK
 MOSI
 MISO
 Data Frame : 8-bit data 
 Data format : no.of bits/frame (MSB/LSB), CPOL & CPHA
 CPOL & CPHA
 Bit Transfer 
 Chip deselect 
 
 SPI data frames can be any size from 4-bits to 16-bits
