Inter-Integrated Circuit : 
	serial communication
	bi-directional
	synchronous
serial communication : 
	process of sending data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a communication channel or computer bus.
	
Lines : 
	SDA - Serial Data (SDA) – send and receive data.
	SCL - Serial Clock (SCL) – It carries the clock signal.
	
I2C operates in 2 modes –

    Master mode
    Slave mode


Data transmission :
start			- start data transmission
Address frame	- 7/10 bits (to identify slave address sent from the master
read/write bit 	- master is sending data to the slave (low) or requesting data from it (high).
Acknowledgement - ACK/NACK
				  address matches, the slave returns an ACK bit , sets SDA line low
				  address from the master does not match the slave, slave leaves the SDA line high
Data frame 		- 8 bits 
				  master sends or receives the data frame
stop			- stop the data transmission

start cond:
SDA high to low , SCL high to low 

stop cond:
SCL high , SDA high

ACK :
	allows the Rx to communicate to the Tx that the byte was successfully received and another byte may be sent
