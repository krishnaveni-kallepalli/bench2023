Linux Architecture:
	User space - user program & application code (C) is executed.
	Kernel space - system interface, Device driivers -- > prvides services 
	
Linux Kernel Modules : pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel

loadable kernel modules (LKM) :  loading codes at runtime
base kernel : located in the /boot directory and is always loaded when we boot our machine
LKM communicate with the base kernel to complete their functions.

	separate address spaces
	higher execution privileges
	do not execute sequentially
	use different header files
	
	
	
	
LKM applications are-

    Device drivers -->	designed for a specific piece of hardware. 
    					The kernel uses it to communicate with that piece of hardware

    Filesystem drivers -->	storing files and directories and such on disk drives, on network servers, and in other ways. 
    						For each way, you need a filesystem driver.

    System calls -->	Userspace programs use system calls to get services from the kernel.
    					Eg: read a file, create a new process, and shut down the system.
 
LKM Advantages - 

 	saves time - donâ€™t need to keep rebuilding the kernel every time we add a new device or if we upgrade an old device. 
 	
 	very flexible - loaded and unloaded with a single line of command
 	
 	
 	
Module - 
	code that can be inserted into the kernel at run-time, such as with insmod or modprobe.

Driver - 
	a bit of code that runs in the kernel to talk to some hardware device.
