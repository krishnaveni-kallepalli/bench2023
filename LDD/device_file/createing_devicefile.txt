device file -
	is important to communicate with the hardware
	allows transparent communication between user-space applications and hardware.
	Adv:You can create the device file even before loading the driver.
	
All device files are stored in /dev directory.
	ls -l /dev/
	
Creating Device File :
	
    Manually : 
    Syntax :	mknod -m <permissions> <name> <dev type> <maj> <min>
    	
    	<permissions> – optional argument,sets permission bits of the new device file to permissions
    	<device type> – Put c(char) or b(block)
	Eg: sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/Devicename c 246 0
	
    Automatically :
    Include the header file linux/device.h and linux/kdev_t.h
    Create the struct Class
    Create Device with the class which is created
    
    	Creating class : 
    	struct class *class_create(struct module *owner,const char *name);
    	owner – pointer to the module that is to “own” this struct class
		name – pointer to a string for the name of this class
